## Full-time

### Dom

<div class='two-columns'>
<div>

- I dropped out of MMathAndCompSci at Oxford
- I ran a math camp company (https://oxsc.eu)
- Later I did a personal coding bootcamp
  - it was hard to find good resources
  - that's where I got the idea of an aggregator of education resources
- I then worked for 1.5 years at the blockchain unicorn Gnosis (https://gnosis.io)
- I travelled extensively in India, my hobbies are meditation, year-round cycling and sauna.

# Problems ðŸ˜•
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Problem #1 

- A lot of people are using the internet for learning
- There doesn't exist a place to view what your friends, colleagues and people you admire are learning
  - [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) is the closest, but that is only for books
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Problem #2

- Finding good resources on the internet is difficult. We still lack an efficient aggregator for education content.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Solution ðŸ˜Œ
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- The goal is to create a social network & search engine for learning resources
- We'll bootstrap this by building *a social network for engineers*.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Products

- a web app - PWA technology will allow us to make it native for desktop & Android with just a little addition to the codebase.
   - PWA doesn't have full support on iOS
- a Chrome extension - will run on any Chromium browser and Firefox.
  - users of Safari may add a bookmark to their bookmarks bar with the same functionality.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Features

There are four main tenets:

1. Users can follow others, or follow just different `tags` of others, e.g. `Javascript`. Or just the tags themselves...
2. Users can tag interesting material with tags such as `Javascript`, `React`, `PWA`.
3. Users will get reputation for these contributions
4. This data will feed into a graph-based search engine for learning resources.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
That was a lot so let's unpack

- We take learning resources very broadly, it includes blog articles, online courses, academic papers, podcasts...
- Just as the current MVP, we'll be using a graph database (Neo4J) and graph query language (GraphQL).
  - That allows us to do efficient graph lookups - e.g. show me all resources that use `React`, `Nextjs` and `Typescript`
- We will try to close popular open-source teams such as Babel, Webpack and React to use this
  - Customer interviews have shown that ppl will use this if OSS celebrities are there.

# Vision ðŸš€
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- After expanding from SE to other engineering domains, we'll expand to all topics
- We can then leverage this search engine to include offline courses (short-term courses), attaining credentials for self-learning and a better hiring platform for businesses.
- Our ultimate goal is to create an education system that would be recognized by governments for purposes of taxes, immigration etc.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monetization

- Due to the ambitions of this project, our main focus is on the execution
- If this plan succeeds, a small capture margin of the value created will be huge absolute wise
- Examples where value can be captured:
  - Small yearly/lifetime fee for personalized searches
  - Commission from sale of offline courses
  - Income-share agreements
  - Commission from hiring
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Seed round

- We're raising $150k.
- We plan to be remote-first with all employees based in Europe/Western Russia
- With that we can have 3.5 FTE (full-time equivalent employees), e.g. myself, Sultan, Dmitry and Ming Ming.
- I will focus on sales & growth and Ming Ming on UX (a superb UX is very important for this project)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Roadmap

- Month 1: Onboard team, pick technologies, begin working.
- Month 2: MVP which has reputation and search
- Month 3: Add social features, begin to use it internally
  - This can be done with little engineering effort. No uploading of custom data, no news feed - users get access to content through daily emails or automatic posting to Slack through webhooks. We're not making a `Facebook` competitor, it's all about the learning.
- Month 4: Close 10 teams
- Month 5: Close 100 teams.
- Month 6+: Expand to other engineering domains (and eventually to all topics). Solvio becomes the **go-to** app for *any* curious soul!
