In this presentation I'm selling 3 things:

- the problem
- the solution

# ðŸ˜• Problem

\newpage

- It is very inflexible. If one applies to Oxford right now, they will begin studying in October 2021. That is *23 months* from now.
- It is *de facto* impossible to get credentials for informal education such as self-learning.
- Finding good materials/resources on the internet is difficult. We still lack an efficient aggregator for education content.
- Education in English is overpriced in Europe, and education *in genera*l is overpriced in US.
  
  and many others.

# ðŸ˜Œ Solution

\newpage

Our goal is to create an *education system* for the 21st century.

One that would be recognized by governments for purposes of taxes, immigration... (We're the first project in history with this aim.)

We also think the best way to bootstrap such a proj is with a B2C app.

I will now describe the chronology of features (might change subject to user interviews & iteration)
